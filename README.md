Project Overview:
The Portfolio Risk Monitoring and Analysis System is a comprehensive platform designed to help investors monitor their portfolio performance, assess risk exposure, and make data-driven decisions. This project integrates financial data from stocks and cryptocurrencies, calculates Value at Risk (VaR) using multiple methodologies, and provides interactive visualizations to analyze portfolio trends and risks effectively.

Objectives:
Centralized Financial Data Management:

Fetch daily stock data using Yahoo Finance API.
Fetch daily cryptocurrency data using the CoinGecko API.
Store all historical market data in a PostgreSQL database for seamless access.
Risk Assessment:

Calculate Value at Risk (VaR) for individual asset classes (stocks and cryptocurrencies) and the entire portfolio.
Use three VaR methodologies:
Historical VaR
Parametric VaR
Monte Carlo VaR
Provide results both as return percentages and actual monetary values.
Interactive Dashboard:

Develop a Python-based dashboard using Dash to visualize portfolio performance and risk metrics.
Include features such as:
Portfolio value breakdown (stocks vs. crypto).
Asset allocation and historical trends.
VaR metrics over time.
Alerts for significant portfolio risks or performance deviations.
Automation and Scheduling:

Automate daily data fetching for stocks and cryptocurrencies.
Update portfolio risk metrics and visualize the latest results.
Provide fallback mechanisms to fetch missed data in case of system downtime.
Key Features:
Data Management:

Database Schema:
market_data table for historical prices.
assets table for tracking stock and cryptocurrency holdings.
transactions table for individual buy/sell records.
portfolio_risk table for storing VaR results.
Ensure data integrity and prevent duplicates using efficient database constraints.
Risk Analysis:

Calculate VaR using portfolio returns, categorized by asset types (stocks and crypto).
Assess potential monetary loss based on portfolio weights, prices, and shares.
Interactive Dashboard:

Portfolio Overview:
Total portfolio value.
Asset allocation (stocks vs. crypto).
Risk Metrics:
VaR values (daily/weekly).
Standard deviation and Sharpe ratio.
Correlation matrix of assets.
Historical Data:
Performance charts for assets and portfolio.
Price trends for individual stocks and crypto.
Automation:

Automate daily data fetching and VaR calculations using Python scripts and schedulers.
Handle API rate limits and missed data scenarios.
